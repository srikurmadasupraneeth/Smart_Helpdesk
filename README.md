  - View a list of their own tickets with current statuses. 
  - View a detailed conversation thread for each ticket, including replies from agents and the AI. 
  - Receive in-app notifications on status changes. 

#### **üë®‚Äçüíº Support Agent**

  - View a dashboard of all tickets assigned to them or waiting for a human. 
  - Review AI-generated suggestions, including the predicted category and a drafted reply. 
  - Edit the AI-drafted reply and send it to the user. 
  - Manually resolve, reopen, or re-assign tickets. 

#### **üëë Admin**

  - Full access to all agent functionalities.
  - **Knowledge Base Management**: Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) KB articles. 
  - **AI Agent Configuration**: Set system-wide settings, such as enabling/disabling AI auto-resolution and adjusting the confidence threshold required for the AI to auto-close a ticket. 

-----

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project is built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** and is fully containerized with Docker for easy setup and deployment. 

#### **Architecture Diagram**

```
+----------------+      +------------------+      +-------------------+      +-----------------+
|   End User     |----->|   Client (React) |----->|  API (Node/Express) |----->|   MongoDB       |
| (Web Browser)  |      |   (Served by Nginx)|      |  (Agentic Logic)    |      | (Database)      |
+----------------+      +------------------+      +-------------------+      +-----------------+
```

#### **Rationale**

  - **React Frontend**: A modern, component-based library ideal for building a fast and responsive single-page application (SPA). Vite provides an extremely fast development experience.
  - **Node.js/Express Backend**: Node.js is perfect for a data-driven, I/O-heavy application like a helpdesk. The agentic workflow is implemented directly within the Node.js service, keeping the architecture simple and monolithic (MERN-only track). 
  - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that offers flexibility for storing varied data structures like tickets, user info, and logs. Its schema-less nature is well-suited for evolving application requirements.
  - **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerization ensures a consistent development and production environment. The entire stack (client, API, database) can be spun up with a single command (`docker compose up`), simplifying the setup process immensely.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

#### **Prerequisites**

  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and Docker Compose

#### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srikurmadasupraneeth/Smart_Helpdesk
cd smart-helpdesk
```

#### **2. Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file inside the `server/` directory by copying the example:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```

The default values in the `.env` file are pre-configured to work with the Docker setup. You can change the `JWT_SECRET` for better security.

#### **3. Run the Application**

Use Docker Compose to build the images and start all the services (client, api, mongo) with a single command from the project root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

  - Add the `-d` flag (`docker compose up --build -d`) to run the containers in detached mode (in the background).

#### **4. Seed the Database**

Once the containers are running, open a new terminal window and run the seed script. This will populate the database with sample users, KB articles, and tickets.

```bash
docker compose exec api node seed.js
```

You should see a "‚úÖ Data Imported Successfully\!" message.

#### **5. Access the Application**

  - **Frontend Client**: [http://localhost:5173](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:5173)
  - **Backend API**: [http://localhost:8080](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8080)

**Default Login Credentials:**

| Role       | Email               | Password |
| :--------- | :------------------ | :------- |
| **Admin** | `admin@example.com` | `123456` |
| **Agent** | `agent@example.com` | `123456` |
| **User** | `user@example.com`  | `123456` |

-----

## ü§ñ Agentic Triage Workflow

When a new ticket is created, a non-blocking, asynchronous triage process is initiated on the server. The workflow is deterministic and rule-based, ensuring it can run without requiring paid LLM API keys (`STUB_MODE=true`).

1.  **Plan**: The plan is hardcoded in `agentService.js` to follow a linear sequence of steps. 
2.  **Classify**: The ticket's title and description are analyzed for keywords. For example, words like "refund" or "invoice" map to `billing`. A pseudo-confidence score is calculated based on the number of keyword matches. 
3.  **Retrieve KB**: The system performs a keyword search against the Knowledge Base articles to find up to 3 relevant, published articles. 
4.  **Draft Reply**: A templated reply is generated, incorporating the titles of the retrieved KB articles as citations. 
5.  **Decision**: The agent checks the system `Config`. If `autoCloseEnabled` is true and the `confidence` score is above the `confidenceThreshold`, the ticket is automatically resolved, and the drafted reply is sent.  Otherwise, the ticket status is set to `waiting_human` for a support agent to review.
6.  **Logging**: Every step of this process‚Äîfrom starting the triage to the final decision‚Äîis recorded in the `AuditLog` collection with a consistent `traceId` for observability.
